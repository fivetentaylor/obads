# Language

- variables
  - point to things? or they are things?
  - point to types, data, functions
- functions
  - substitute variable(s) into code
  - type = return-type + name + param-type
  - return type is infered from definition
  - lambdas just have return-type + lambda + param-type ?
    - does that mean lambda's with the same return + param are equal? yes...
- data
  - type = whatever you say it is?
  - direct access to bytes
    - data structures over bytes?
- collections
  - struct, lists, hashes, trees, queues...
  - are these built in? or defined in the language?
